## Always be learning. 
I've come to data science in a round-a-bout way. I don't have a masters or PhD in advanced statistics. Almost all my stats knowledge has been gained through self-study. Linear algebra is forever a work in progress. I'd like to share not only analyses and projects I've done, but resources that got me to where I am today. I'll also post occasionally when I feel I have something interesting to say about a topic. Feel free to hit me up on Twitter at @wukaiyuan. I've learned most of what I know about data science through free online resources so I'd like to give back where I can. Good luck!
